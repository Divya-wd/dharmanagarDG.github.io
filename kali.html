<center><h2 style="color:pink;"> Kali Puja Festival: One of the main festivals is the Kali Puja which occurs between September and October and is where the children, adults and the elderly enjoy famously. Dharmanagar is also known for its bright lights during this Puja where the entire town is lit up beautifully. All the people of Tripura knows that in term of MAA KALI PUJA, Dharmanagar is the best city for its big pandals & crowd. Dighi, Shops, Markets and Temples: The playgrounds (BBI & DNV), shopping mall (RANA PLAZA), Dharmanagar super market, shops and the famous pond or the "Dighi" in and around the town centre are the heart of this small town. The illuminated fountain at the middle of the "Dighi", local shops and Kalibari Temple around the Dighi at night makes a wonderful sight. </h2></center>
